### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [nalgnaohel](https://github.com/nalgnaohel)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a third-year student at VNU-UET - K67-CS1
- âœ¨ I'm currently learning Computer Science
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some interesting open-source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not sure this is a fun fact, but my account is just my full name written backward, so I don't even know how to read it =))

(Why am I creating this at 4 a.m. Friday 13 :( )
