### Glad you come here <3

- 🌟 I’m a third-year student at VNU-UET - K67-CS1
- ✨ I'm currently learning Computer Science, and am interested in Software Engineering related topics
- 🐱 Fun fact: I'm not sure this is a fun fact, but my account is just my full name written backward, so I don't even know how to read it =))
